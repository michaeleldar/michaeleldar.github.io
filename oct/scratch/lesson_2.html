        <h1>Scratch Lesson 2</h1>
        <h2>You need to open a scratch project to follow this lesson, open one by clicking <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor">here</a>.</h2>
        <h3>In this lesson, we will make a cat and mouse game.<br>In this game, you get chased by a cat and you are a mouse.<br>We will also add a points system.</h3>
        <h3>First, will code the mouse. Leave the scratch cat and make another sprite by pressing the button in the bottom right of the sprite area.<br>Search mouse and you should see one like below. Click on it to add it.</h3>
        <p><img src="blocks/mouse.svg"></p>
        <h3>Now add the blocks below, we will explain them after.</h3>
        <p><img src="blocks/blocks9.png"></p>
        <h3>When Green Flag Clicked: Detects when the green flag is clicked and runs the code underneath it.</h3>
        <h3>Forever: This is the first and the most simple loop we will do. It runs anything between it until the stop sign is clicked.</h3>
        <h3>Point Towards Mouse Pointer: It is quite self-explanitary although, you can click "Mouse Pointer" and change to a sprite.</h3>
        <h3>Move 10 Steps: Makes the sprite move ten steps/pixels in the direction it is pointing. Ten steps is a lot less than it looks!</h3>
        <h3>That wasn't so bad was it! Now we will make the cat follow the mouse.</h3>
        <h3>Your mouse should follow your mouse-pointer like in this:</h3>
        <p><iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/659668709/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <h3>Add this code to the cat sprite.</h3>
        <p><img src="blocks/blocks11.png"></p>
        <h3>New Blocks:</h3>
        <h3>if [     ] then: looks at the items between [ and ] and works out if it is true. If it is true then it runs the blocks inside it, otherwise it does not.</h3>
        <h3>touching Mouse1: It detects if the sprite is touching the Mouse1 sprite and it is true if it does. The mouse 1 can be replaced with other sprites, mouse-pointer and edge.</h3>
        <h3>stop all: Stops everything that is going on in the project. You can replace the all with other things, and we will look at that later.</h3>
        <h3>Run your project now. You might find that when you get caught for the first time, you can't stop getting caught emidiatly.<br>There is a better way to fix this, but for now just drag the cat away when you are caught.</h3>
        <h3>This is what your project should be like:</h3>
        <p><iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/659687201/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <h3>Now we will make the score system. To get points you make your mouse touch a apple.</h3>
        <h3>Click the button to add another sprite and search apple. Then select the one that looks like this:</h3>
        <p><img src="blocks/apple.svg"></p>
        <h3>Now click on the variables section in the blocks section. Then you will see a button "Make a variable".</h3>
        <h3>Click that button and type in "score". Leave the other options as they are. Then press "OK".</h3>
        <h3>A variable is a name for a number or word. The number or work can change but you can still access it with the name.</h3>
        <h3>Now add the code below:</h3>
        <h5>Note: click "my variable" in the code and change it to score.</h5>
        <p><img src="blocks/blocks10.png"></p>
        <h3>New Blocks:</h3>
        <h3>Set score to 0: This sets the value variable called "score" to 0. 0 could be replaced with any text or numbers.</h3>
        <h3>Go to random position: does what it says it would do, go to a random position. random position can be replaced with mouse-pointer and any sprite.</h3>
        <h3>Change Score by 1: This adds 1 to the value of "score". The 1 can be changed to another number.</h3>
        <h3>Now try running it. The score is in the top left corner of the screen.</h3>
        <h3>It should do the same as below:</h3>
        <p><iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/659690584/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <h3>If you found the game too hard, try changing the move 8 steps to move 5 steps.<br>Thank you for using Lesson 1 of the Innovation Studios online coding tutorial. Please report any errors in this lesson,<br>coding related or not to me. If you are having problems, send me a message on google chat.<br>If you need any other programming help, contact me there aswell. Bye for now - Michael.</h3>
